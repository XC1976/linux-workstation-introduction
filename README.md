# ðŸŽ¯ Goals of this wiki
The purpose of this wiki is to give newcomers all the **ESSENTIAL knowledge needed to switch to Linux as a workstation and nothing more**.

<ins>Here are the core principles</ins> :
- **Beginner-friendly** : The wiki is tailored for Windows and MacOS users who may be interested in using Linux as a workstation.
- **Straight to the point** : I assume the audience see their computers as a tool and not as a hobby and just want to get things done. Unnecessary technical topics are not mentioned if it does not provide tangible benefits.
- **Usability over philosophy** : I want to teach how to adopt Linux as a workstation and be productive, not how to embrace the free and open-source software movement, therefore, I am not biased towards proprietary software.

# ðŸ“– Wiki
The wiki is intended to be read in a linear way like a book.

1. Application compatibility
2. Linux installation
3. Linux additional productivity benefits
